2. Open `profiles` table
3. You should see your profile data
4. Fields: first_name, last_name, email, bio, location, avatar_url

### Check Avatars Storage

2. You should see a folder with your user ID
3. Inside: your uploaded avatar image
4. Image should be publicly accessible

## Troubleshooting

### If signup returns an error
- Make sure the server is running (`npm run server:dev`)
- Check browser console for specific error
- Verify Supabase credentials in `.env`

### If email doesn't arrive
- Check spam folder
- Verify email provider allows Supabase emails
- Or disable email confirmation temporarily:
  - Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Providers > Email
  - Uncheck "Enable email confirmations"

### If login fails
- Make sure email is verified (check inbox)
- Or disable email confirmation (see above)
- Check that password is correct

### If profile won't load
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify RLS policies in Supabase
