## üü° REQUIRES CONFIGURATION

### To Connect Real Supabase (Optional)

If you want to use **real Supabase Auth and Storage**, update `.env`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.[project].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Note:** This is optional! The app works fine with localStorage auth.

### To Enable Payments (Optional)

For real Stripe payments, add to `.env`:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
MEMBERSHIP_PRICE_ID=price_...
```

**Note:** Payment UI is ready, just needs Stripe keys to process real charges.

### To Enable File Uploads (Optional)

Currently files are metadata-only. To enable real file uploads:

1. Configure Supabase Storage buckets: `resources-original`, `resources-preview`, `temp-uploads`
2. Or integrate another storage provider (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)

**Note:** Upload UI exists, just needs storage backend connected.
